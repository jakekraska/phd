This repository includes the data and code required for the cleaning and analyses in the PhD thesis.

## Abstract

The current thesis explored the application of a Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) in the measurement of intelligence, the efficiency and validity of a CAT when measuring intelligence across a range of ages, and considered correlations of this newly developed CAT with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children â€“ Fifth Edition (WISC-V). 

Any measurement tool in psychology must be developed based on a good theoretical framework and sound measurement principles. The background of this thesis (Chapter 2) demonstrated that the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory is the most contemporary and suitable theory of intelligence to form the theoretical basis of a cognitive ability CAT. It is also important that researchers implement appropriate statistical models when developing and implementing a CAT, and thus the background of this thesis introduced many basic concepts related to different item response theory (IRT) models and characteristics of CATs that some readers may be unfamiliar with. Some authors have argued that the measurement of cognitive ability has lacked new innovations despite significant improvements in available technologies in the last two decades. CATs pose an opportunity to improve measurement of cognitive ability through the integration of CHC theory, IRT measurement principles and variation of CAT characteristics. 

A review of the literature in this thesis demonstrated that despite CHC, IRT and CAT all being well known concepts within the literature, there has been only limited integration of the three together. Nearly all studies reviewed failed to describe the CAT used with enough detail for their studies to be replicated by researchers or implemented by practicing psychologists. Additionally, none of the CATs investigated demonstrated utility with an Australian sample or truly examined more than one CHC factor at a time.

The four studies in this thesis investigated the use of four sets of items developed from the perspective of CHC theory, designed to measure Lexical Knowledge, Induction, Visualisation and Working Memory. Both the data and statistical analyses for all four studies included in this thesis are accessible at github.com/jakekraska/phd.

The item sets were trialled and evaluated in an Item Tryout Study (ITOS; Chapter 3) and an Item Calibration Study (ICS; Chapter 4). The initial ITOS demonstrated that the Lexical Knowledge items tended to be too easy, Induction items were not always predictable in their ordering, there were possible unidimensionality issues with the Visualisation items, and that there were design issues with the Working Memory item stimuli. The ICS took advantage of further item development and addressed problems with item sets as identified by the ITOS and the analysis resulted in retaining 47 Lexical Knowledge items, 23 Induction items, 30 Visualisation items, 25 Working Memory items. Item parameters were exported for subsequent CAT simulation.

Each item set was included in a CAT simulation (Chapter 5) that made use of 5,000 simulated participant. Simulations were conducted with each item set using item parameters from the ICS and item parameters recalculated using only the school aged sample. Simulations were conducted for varying levels of reliability required utilising a minimum standard error of measurement (SEM) stop rule. A final simulation was conducted for each item set to evaluate where the item sets measured best. Overall, 52 simulations were conducted. It was found that that item administration could be reduced by approximately 50% when aiming for a reliability of .70, and the item sets best measured at very low ability levels through to average abilities. If such a test were implemented in practice, testing time would be approximately 18 minutes depending on the ability of the examinee. Classification of those with deficits in cognitive abilities could be achieved, however differentiation between those with average ability and above average ability may not be possible with the current item sets. 

Analysis of the convergent validity of the items was investigated (Chapter 6). Weak to moderate correlations were found between each CHC-CAT subtest and the respective WISC-V subtest, and a moderate correlation was found between a statistically derived g factor and the WISC-V Full Scale IQ. Based on the results there is mounting evidence of the psychometric validity of the Lexical Knowledge and Induction item sets from this PhD. Further analysis is recommended to compare the Working Memory item sets into other cognitively complex Working Memory tasks, as well as further development of Visualisation items that provide a better fit to the Rasch model. 

A discussion (Chapter 7) of the implications and limitations of this research is also presented. Future research opportunities are identified surrounding multidimensional IRT, use of other IRT models, improvements and standardisation in item stimuli via funded multimedia design, further item development, and implementation of items that measure other CHC abilities. Overall, it is concluded that this research demonstrates the viability of CAT implementation into the measurement of CHC abilities and hopes to serve as a platform for future innovations.

## Installation and Running

* Clone this repo to your local machine using https://github.com/jakekraska/phd
* Open each chapters R code in your preferred IDE, starting with the first chapter
* Set the working directory to the source file within the IDE or using `setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext($path)`
* Install the necessary packages using the `install.packages("PACKAGENAME")` command
* Each chapter may have used older versions of packages and thus you may need to specify the URL. For example:
    * `packageurl <- "http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/ggplot2/ggplot2_0.9.1.tar.gz"`
    * `install.packages(packageurl, repos = NULL, type = "source")`
    * If you don't know the URL, you can look for it in the [CRAN binary archive](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive)
* The code is moderately commented and minimal SEM, IRT and CAT knowledge should allow understanding of the output. Some R knowledge is required to understand the code.
